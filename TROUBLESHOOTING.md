# Troubleshooting Dwarf With Friends

Start here if setup or hosting stops before you get a link. These instructions assume you
downloaded Dwarf With Friends from the project's official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JakesDwarfAccount/dwarf-with-friends/releases)
page.

## First load, and the refresh fix

**The very first time you open the fort, give it ~30 seconds.** The art streams in as it loads,
so the map can look sparse or partly blank for a moment before everything pops in. If it seems
stuck, refresh the tab once or twice: the first load is the slow one.

After that, if something looks wrong **while playing**, refresh the tab: and if a normal refresh
doesn't do it, hard-refresh with **Ctrl+Shift+R**. This fixes most transient issues:

- units drawn as **yellow circles** or tiles as **blue boxes** (sprite art didn't finish loading);
- the map stuck partially loaded or frozen;
- panels or windows behaving oddly after the host restarted the game.

Nothing is lost by refreshing: you rejoin automatically with your name and the fort streams right
back in.

**If some sprites stay yellow dots no matter how many times you refresh**: usually rarer things
like a visiting bard or a specific creature: it's because that art hasn't been generated yet.
The fix is on the **host's** side: the host tabs into their Steam client and simply *looks at*
those tiles on their screen for a moment. That makes the game render the missing sprites, which
then propagate to every browser immediately. (A friend refreshing won't fix it; the host viewing
them will.)

If a problem *survives* a hard refresh and isn't the host-view case above, it's worth reporting.

## The game is laggy or choppy while playing

Press **F3** in the browser to open the diagnostics overlay. It shows how your session is
actually running, which points straight at the cause.

**Transport**: how map data is arriving:

- **`WS delta`** is what you want: a live WebSocket sending only what changed. Smooth.
- If it says it fell back to **HTTP polling**, the WebSocket didn't connect, and you'll get
  periodic hitching. Fixes, in order: **hard-refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R); try a **different browser**
  (some browsers' privacy/ad-block extensions or aggressive shields interfere: Chrome with
  extensions paused is the safe baseline); disable browser extensions for the game's page. If
  you're the host and *everyone* is on HTTP, a firewall or proxy is blocking the socket.

**Renderer**: how the map is drawn:

- **`gl`** (WebGL) is the fast default and runs at your monitor's refresh rate.
- **`canvas2d`** is the automatic fallback if your browser can't do WebGL (old GPU, disabled
  hardware acceleration, a lost graphics context). It works but is slower on big, busy views.
- If you're on `canvas2d` and want to force WebGL back: make sure **hardware acceleration** is ON
  in your browser settings, then reload. You can also force a renderer with a URL switch ,
  add `?renderer=gl` (or `?renderer=canvas2d`) to the `/view` address: handy for testing which
  one behaves better on your machine.

**Other lag causes worth checking:**

- **A slow or distant tunnel.** If you're joining over a `trycloudflare.com` link, all traffic
  detours through Cloudflare: usually fine, but a bad route adds latency for everyone. For a
  regular friend group, a Tailscale connection is often snappier (see the manual-install guide).
- **A huge, busy fort.** Hundreds of active units or a full-screen zoomed-out view is more work to
  stream and draw. Zooming in a little, or a smaller window, lightens both the network and the
  renderer.
- **Too many browser tabs / low memory.** The client keeps a map cache; a machine already tight on
  RAM will stutter. Close heavy tabs and other apps.
- **The host machine is the bottleneck.** If the host's own game is chugging, everyone feels it ,
  the fort only streams as fast as it simulates.

If none of that helps and it *survives a hard refresh*, capture what F3 shows (transport,
renderer, and the FPS/latency numbers) and include it when asking for help: it tells us exactly
which layer is slow.

## Windows asks whether to run `DWF Setup.cmd` (Windows only)

A freshly downloaded `.cmd` file is expected to show a Mark-of-the-Web warning with **Run** and
**Cancel** choices. Choose **Run** to open setup. The exact Windows wording has not yet been
confirmed on the required clean-machine test, so it is deliberately not quoted here.

If you downloaded the file from anywhere other than the official Releases page, choose **Cancel**
and get a fresh copy from Releases.

## Antivirus removed the plugin DLL

Some antivirus tools may quarantine `dwf.plug.dll` as a false positive. Only restore it if it came
from the official GitHub Release. (On Linux the plugin is `dwf.plug.so` and antivirus interference
is rare, but the same rule holds: restore only a file that came from the official Release.)

For Windows Security:

1. Open **Windows Security** → **Virus & threat protection** → **Protection history**.
2. Open the entry for `dwf.plug.dll`, then choose **Actions** → **Restore** or **Allow on device**.
3. Under **Virus & threat protection settings**, open **Manage settings** → **Exclusions** →
   **Add or remove exclusions**. Add both copies of `dwf.plug.dll`, the one under the extracted
   `DwarfWithFriends\release` folder and the one under your Dwarf Fortress `hack\plugins` folder, as
   file exclusions.
4. Run `DWF Setup.cmd` (Windows) / `./dwf-setup.sh` (Linux) again so setup can replace the missing
   file.

For another antivirus product, restore `dwf.plug.dll` from its quarantine and allowlist both the
release copy and the copy in Dwarf Fortress's `hack\plugins` folder before running setup again.

## "capture-stream-start is not a recognized command"

This error while hosting means DFHack never loaded the Dwarf With Friends plugin. In practice it
has one cause: **your DFHack version does not exactly match the one this build was made for**
(DFHack **53.16-r1** for this release). DFHack refuses to load plugins built for any other
version: even one bugfix release apart: so the plugin's commands simply don't exist.

1. Check your DFHack version: it's on the DFHack title screen, or at the top of `hack\news.rst`
   in your Dwarf Fortress folder.
2. If it isn't exactly **53.16-r1**, install that version from the
   [DFHack releases page](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/releases/tag/53.16-r1): close
   Dwarf Fortress, back up your existing DFHack configuration and scripts, extract the 53.16-r1 archive into your Dwarf
   Fortress folder, then run **DWF Setup.cmd** (Windows) / **`./dwf-setup.sh`** (Linux) again to
   re-install the mod.
3. If your DFHack came from Steam, note Steam may auto-update it past the supported version;
   the manual install above avoids that.
4. Confirmation lives in `stderr.log` in your Dwarf Fortress folder: a line saying the `dwf`
   plugin was built for a different version of DFHack.

## Dwarf Fortress starts without DFHack (Linux only)

If the game opens but DFHack never appears: no DFHack terminal, and none of the plugin's commands
exist: the game's Steam launch options are almost always the reason. The host panel starts Dwarf
Fortress through Steam so it gets Steam's own per-game environment, and Steam applies the game's
launch options when it does. Right-click **Dwarf Fortress** in Steam → **Properties** →
**Launch Options**, set them to exactly:

```text
sh -c 'exec "./dfhack"' %command%
```

Close the game and start hosting again.

If you are driving DFHack by hand, note that `dfhack-run` on Linux needs a real terminal and
crashes when its output is piped. The host panel already runs it under a pseudo-terminal, so this
only matters for commands you type yourself.

## DFHack overlay tools while streaming (Windows)

DFHack's on-screen tools (workshop toggles, stockpile import/export buttons, the mod manager
button, info panels) come from DFHack's `overlay` plugin. On Windows this build keeps that plugin
enabled while the stream is running: remote cameras are drawn into dwf's own private viewport
buffers, so the host's screen is never re-rendered from the capture thread and DFHack overlay Lua
never runs there.

- To go back to the old behaviour (overlay disabled for the whole stream), create an empty file
  named `dfcapture_disable_overlay.txt` in the Dwarf Fortress folder and restart the stream.
- If the direct map renderer is unavailable on your DF build, dwf disables the overlay by itself
  for that stream and says so in the DFHack console; it is restored when the stream stops.
- While the overlay is enabled, art and engraving descriptions that are not already cached are
  not generated for browser players (that path needs a host viewscreen render).

## Diagnostic log retention

The plugin writes `dwf.log` in the Dwarf Fortress folder. The active log is capped at 4 MiB. When
it reaches that size, the previous contents move to `dwf.log.1` and a fresh `dwf.log` begins. Only
those two generations are retained, so copy both files before restarting repeatedly when reporting
a difficult crash or stall.

## Port 8765 is already in use

Dwarf With Friends uses port 8765 by default. Another copy of Dwarf With Friends, an old plugin,
or another program may already be using it.

1. Close any other Dwarf Fortress or Dwarf With Friends window, then try **Start hosting** again.
2. If the port is still busy, open **Config** in the host panel, change **Game connection port**
   from `8765` to another unused port such as `8766`, choose **Save config**, and start hosting
   again.
3. If you upgraded from an older build, also follow [Remove the old plugin after upgrading](#remove-the-old-plugin-after-upgrading).

## The friend link never appears

The friend link comes from cloudflared, the tunnel that lets friends reach you over the internet.
Leave Dwarf Fortress and the Dwarf With Friends engine window open while it starts.

The host panel shows the tunnel's status and a live log tail: check it for the reason the link
didn't appear (no network connection, a blocked cloudflared process, and so on). If it stays stuck
waiting for a link, use the panel's **Restart the tunnel** button. The same log is written to
`host/cloudflared.log` inside the extracted `DwarfWithFriends` folder; keep those last lines when
asking for help.

If the log says cloudflared is missing, run `DWF Setup.cmd` (Windows) / `./dwf-setup.sh` (Linux)
again and repair the **Get cloudflared** step. If it reports a network error, check the connection
and try again. If you'd rather not use cloudflared at all, [MANUAL-INSTALL.md](docs/MANUAL-INSTALL.md) has a Tailscale option.

## Windows Firewall asks about Dwarf Fortress (Windows only)

On the first Dwarf Fortress launch, Windows may ask whether to allow network access. Allow Dwarf
Fortress/DFHack on **Private networks** so the local browser stream can run. You do not need to
enable **Public networks** for the normal cloudflared setup.

## Remove the old plugin after upgrading

DFHack loads every plugin DLL it finds. An older Dwarf With Friends install can therefore load both
the old `dfcapture` plugin and the new `dwf` plugin, causing port conflicts and erratic behaviour.

1. Close Dwarf Fortress completely.
2. Open your Dwarf Fortress folder.
3. Delete `hack/plugins/dfcapture.plug.dll`.
4. Delete `hack/lua/plugins/dfcapture.lua`.
5. Start Dwarf Fortress again.

Do not delete `dwf.plug.dll` or `hack/lua/plugins/dwf.lua`; those are the current files.

## Beta 4 interface issues and fallback

Beta 4.1 fixes most of the interface regressions from beta 4. If something still gets in your way, [beta 3](https://github.com/JakesDwarfAccount/dwarf-with-friends/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.3) remains the more stable fallback. Its Windows and Linux packages require Dwarf Fortress 0.53.15 with DFHack 53.15-r2; beta 4 and 4.1 require Dwarf Fortress 0.53.16 with DFHack 53.16-r1. Follow beta 3’s own setup instructions in a compatible installation. Do not assume a save opened in a newer Dwarf Fortress version can be downgraded.
